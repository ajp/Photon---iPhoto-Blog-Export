		<p>Though you can specify an ‘override’ size for any of your exported images in Photon’s main window, you may want to define a ‘default’ image size for your photo–blog; a kind of “set it and forget it” option if you plan to keep all the photos in your blog the same size.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>To specify a default size for your exported photos, fill in the ‘default max width’ and ‘default max height’ fields in the Image Upload tab of Photon’s Settings dialog.</p></div>
		<p>These defaults are treated as “absolute maximum” sizes for your exported images; limits that will not be broken regardless of the orientation or cropping of your photos.</p>
		<p>If, for example, you want to limit the width of your images but don’t care about their height, specify a ‘default max width’ value but leave the ‘default max height’ field blank: the aspect–ratios of your exported photos will be preserved, but the maximum width you set will be obeyed. This rule applies in “restricted height/unrestricted width” situations, too.</p>
		<p>You can also specify how your exported images should be named. This setting has no effect on how photos appear in your photo–blog, only on the file names they are given on the server.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>To define how exported image files are named, select one of “Use original file name”, “Use title”, or “Use time stamp” from the list of radio buttons in the Image Upload tab of Photon’s Settings dialog.</p>
		<p>Thumbnails may, additionally, have the word “thumbnail” appended to their name. This setting can be toggled from a checkbox in the Image Upload tab of Photon’s settings dialog.</p></div>
