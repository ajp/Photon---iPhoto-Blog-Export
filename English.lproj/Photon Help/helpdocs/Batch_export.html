		<div id="pagecontent">
		<p>Exporting many photos at once can save considerable time and effort, and is functionally no different to performing as many individual exports in a row.</p>
		<p>During a batch export, discrete entries are created for each photo and the individual details of each photo are used as per your Entry Creation settings. All photos are assigned to the same category, and all are sized according to the same default or overridden size preference.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>To export a batch of photos at once, select a photo album or group of individual photos in iPhoto and then perform a normal export using Photon.</p>
		<p>You can select a group of photos in the iPhoto window by holding down Command as you click them, or by holding down Shift and selecting a contiguous range.</p></div>
		<p>Batch exporting is a feature limited to registered users of Photon. Unregistered users attempting a batch export will only be able to export the first selected photo.</p>
