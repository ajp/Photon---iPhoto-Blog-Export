		<p>Any time Photon communicates with your blogging software (during export, category retrieval, and category creation) it needs to identify itself to the server with your user name and password. When you create an account in Photon you have the option to fill in your user name and password in the Account Information tab, which Photon stores in your secure system keychain for later use.</p>
		<p>If you choose not to enter your user name and password, Photon will prompt you for it when required.</p>
