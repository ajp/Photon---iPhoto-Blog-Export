		<p>Accounts are managed in the Settings dialog, which can be brought forward by pressing the button labeled ‘Settings…’ in Photon’s main window. Your existing accounts are listed in the table to the left of the sheet, while new accounts can be added and unwanted accounts removed by pressing either of the ‘+/-’ (plus/minus) buttons at the bottom–left.</p>
		<p>The configuration of each account is split amongst three tabs drawn along the top edge of the sheet labeled ‘Account Information’, ‘Entry Creation’, and ‘Image Upload’, respectively. At the very minimum, you must fill in the fields in the Account Information tab; Photon uses the information you supply in these fields to communicate with your server’s blogging software.</p>
		<p>The contents of the Entry Creation and Image Upload tabs are options made available to customize Photon’s output, it is not necessary that you change them from their defaults. These options are covered in more detail in other Photon Help documents listed below.</p>
