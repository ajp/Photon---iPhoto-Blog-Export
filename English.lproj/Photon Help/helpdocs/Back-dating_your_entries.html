		<p>By default, blog entries are stamped with the date and time they are created by the blogging software. To maintain a true chronology in your photo–blog, you may prefer to have Photon adjust these time stamps to reflect the time–codes stored in iPhoto.</p>
		<p>This way your blog entries will be stamped with the date and time the photo itself was taken, rather than the date and time they are exported from iPhoto.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>To date your blog entries with the time–code information kept by iPhoto, check the box labeled “Use iPhoto time stamp for entry date &amp; time” in the Entry Creation tab of Photon’s Settings dialog.</p></div>
