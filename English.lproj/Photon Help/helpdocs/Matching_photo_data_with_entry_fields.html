		<div id="pagecontent">
		<p>New blog entries sport a number of empty text fields that can be filled with any information you please; fields named Entry title, Entry body, Extended entry, Entry excerpt, and Keywords. They are the simple “components” of an entry, parts that come together in your templates to form a cohesive whole, and all of these empty entry components can be filled by Photon using the information in your iPhoto photo library.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>To choose which information is fed to which entry field, pair them together as you see fit using the pop–up menus in the Entry Creation tab of Photon’s Settings dialog. Your selection in each pop–up menu functions as a noun in the sentence “Use [selection] for [selection]”. For example, “Use title for entry title” tells Photon to use iPhoto’s title information for the weblog entry’s title.</p></div>
		<p>By default, Photon uses the settings “Use title for entry title”, “Use photo for entry body”, and “Use thumbnail for entry excerpt”. These settings can be removed, changed, or added to as you see fit.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>To remove a line from the list of entry creation settings, press the ‘-’ (minus) button to the right of that line.</p></div>
		<p>Removing a line from the settings tab effectively sets that entry field to ‘empty’; the field is not filled. If, for instance, there are no fields that use the ‘thumbnail’ option, no thumbnail will be uploaded to the server; this rule applies to the ‘photo’ option, too.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>To add a new line to the list of entry creation settings, press the ‘+’ (plus) button to the far right of any line.</p></div>
		<p>Adding a line lets you define new settings for entry fields not included in Photon’s defaults; fields such as ‘extended entry’ and ‘keywords’.</p>
		<p>The <code>alt</code> and <code>title</code> text, which are HTML <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> tag attributes, can also be set for the entry’s images. The <code>alt</code> attribute is used to provide alternate descriptive text for the image, acting as a textual replacement for the image for visually impaired users or people browsing in text–only mode. The <code>title</code> attribute performs a similar function, though it is more commonly used to produce ‘tooltips’ for images in web pages.</p>
		<p>To avoid conflicts when you add a new line to Photon’s entry creation settings, entry fields that have already been defined are disabled in the new settings’ pop–up menu. Removing an existing line will re–enable the option in other lines.
