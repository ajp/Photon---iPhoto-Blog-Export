		<p>If Photon cannot fetch your category listing from the server, it is most likely due to a loss of internet connection. In these cases a small “lightning bolt” button will appear to the right of the pop–up menu labeled ‘Category’ in Photon’s main window to indicate that you are now working offline.</p>
		<div class="taskbox"><p>If you are working offline and want to attempt server connection again, click the “lightning bolt” button.</p></div>
		<p>Clicking the “lightning bolt” button will attempt another connection with the server. If a successful connection is made, Photon will retrieve your category listing.</p>
		<p>If Photon still cannot retrieve your categories from the server, check your internet connection and try again.</p>
