		<div id="pagecontent">		<p>Here's a quick look at what you can do with Photon. To learn more, browse or search Photon Help.</p>		<h2>Manage <em>all</em> your photo–blogs</h2>		<p>Photon’s ‘Settings’ dialog can handle as many accounts as you can, so managing a dozen blogs —whether they’re all in one place, powered by different blogging software, or hosted on different servers— is no sweat. Your only hassle is choosing which ones to post to.</p>
		<h2>Your entries, your way</h2>
		<p>Every blog is different, so Photon gives you all the control you need to make your exported photos match your existing templates. Customize titles, entry bodies, keywords, and even time stamps within Photon’s intuitive Entry Creation tab; and while you’re at it you can customize your photo sizing, file naming, and upload paths from the Image Upload tab to keep everything organized on the server’s side.</p>		<h2>Categories left, right, and center</h2>		<p>If you like to keep everything organized by categorizing the photos in your photo–blog, we’ve got you covered; assign photos to as many or as few categories as you please. And if you need something fresh, Photon supports category creation, too.</p>		</div>	</body></html>
